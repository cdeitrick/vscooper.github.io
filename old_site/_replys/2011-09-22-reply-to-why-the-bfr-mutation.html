<p>I think it's high time we really considered optimal experimental designs to determine why this mutation fixed.  I know Chuck thinks it rises only in the context of its competitors/ecotypes AT THAT TIME, which is very interesting and testable. But it seems that we need bfr mutations in the ancestor and in other genotypes, but which ones?</p>
