<p>I am pleased to announce that this summer, my laboratory will be moving to the <a href="http://www.medschool.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a>, in the <a href="http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/">Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics</a>. I will likely be jointly appointed in the <a href="http://www.csb.pitt.edu/">Department of Computational and Systems Biology</a> and anticipate great interactions with researchers in the <a href="http://www.biology.pitt.edu/graduate">Biology Department</a> of the University of Pittsburgh and in the <a href="http://www.cfrc.pitt.edu/index.html">Cystic Fibrosis Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>The primary focus of the <a href="http://micropopbio.org/cooperlab">Cooper laboratory</a> is to use genomics and experimental models to propel a virtuous cycle of inquiry using <strong>i) evolutionary-genetic and ecological theory, ii) laboratory models of evolution, </strong>and<strong> iii) pathogen evolution during human infections</strong>. We are especially interested in <strong>adaptation in the structured environments of bacterial biofilms</strong>, which cause a large fraction of human infections and serve as tractable models of multispecies communities and the ecosystem of many cancers.</p>

<p><strong>WE ARE RECRUITING</strong>. Applications from creative postdoctoral scholars who share these goals and want to help us lead initiatives in evolutionary biology, genomics, and microbiome research at a Top-5 U.S. medical school are welcome. This is an exceptional opportunity to a launch a career in the in-demand field of evolutionary genomics.</p>
<p>I also welcome talented Ph.D. applicants, particularly those who are motivated to pursue independent fellowships. Graduate programs in which I hope to participate include the <a href="http://gradbiomed.pitt.edu/">Interdisciplinary Biomedical Training Program</a>, <a href="http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/">Computational Biology</a> (joint with Carnegie Mellon), and <a href="http://www.isb.pitt.edu/">Integrative Systems Biology</a>.</p>
<p>Our laboratory will be supported by a generous startup, which will feature in-house Illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, and a NIH-NIGMS R01 on mechanisms of biofilm adaptation, a <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/teams/can-7/umt/"><strong>NASA Astrobiology Institute award</strong></a>, and two collaborative awards from NSF.</p>
<p>More about our ongoing research, including <a title="Genome Evolution" href="http://www.micropopbio.org/cooperlab/research/chromosome-evolution/">why genome regions evolve at different rates</a>, and an <a href="http://evolvingstem.org">evolution-in-action curriculum for our nation’s high schools</a>, are described on our webpages.</p>
