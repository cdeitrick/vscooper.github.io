<p>We invite applications for Ph.D students interested in projects at the intersection of microbial ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and physiology. We find that students with experience in evolutionary biology and microbiology get off to a great start; those who are good geneticists or microbiologists but not familiar with evolution face some hurdles, but certainly not insurmountable.</p>
<p><strong>We also invite applications for highly qualified postdoctoral scholars to study evolution-in-action, both in the lab and during infections, using population sequencing and microbial ecology and genetics. These positions are supported by awards from NIH and NASA but we will support applications by the fellow for independent research funding.</strong></p>
<p>We are currently searching for a Senior Research Technician. This job description is posted <a href="http://www.micropopbio.org/cooperlab/?p=802">here</a>.</p>
<p>We always have several undergraduates and sometimes high school interns in the laboratory, but admission is competitive and requires a fit with my graduate students and technicians who might mentor them. Prospective undergraduate researchers, please familiarize yourself with our research before inquiring. I apologize if I can't always reply to all inquiries.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your interest.</p>
<p>Vaughn</p>
