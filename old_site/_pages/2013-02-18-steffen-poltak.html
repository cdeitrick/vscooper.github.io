<p>Steffen Poltak received his PhD in Microbiology from UNH in May 2010, and is now an assistant professor at St. Anselm College in Manchester, NH.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Research Interests</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Ecology and evolution of Burkholderia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm communities</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Major research questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">What happens in bacterial populations after prolonged selection in a biofilm environment?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">What beneficial mutations are acquired under biofilm conditions?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">How does biofilm diversity effect population productivity?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">How does biofilm diversity arise and how do new members interact? Antagonistic / Synergistic/ or Neutral</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Do evolved biofilm populations harbor genotypes that have increased virulence and/or increased antibiotic resistance?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">How do biofilm subpopulations interact to survive? What are there contributions to the form and function of the biofilm community? Are the interactions synergistic, antagonistic, or something in between?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My interests lie not only in the interactions seen between various genotypes seen within a species, but also between those seen between different species. Â The answers to these questions are essential in properly understanding the evolution of microbial communities, but more importantly they may prove vital in the treatment of chronic biofilm infections.</p>
