<h4>Nematode susceptibility to <em>Burkholderia</em> infection depends upon prior diet and secreted bacterial attractants</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007961"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-219" title="journal.pone.0007961.g002" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/journal.pone_.0007961.g002-1fxedxg.png" alt="" width="473" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>The nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> is a model organism for studying interactions between bacteria and animal hosts, however, growing nematodes on prey bacteria may influence these interactions, and nematode susceptibility to potential pathogens.  We found that prior diet altered the interactions between <em></em>nematodes and bacteria. A preference for <em>Burkholderia</em> or <em>E. coli </em>isolates as a food source was associated with the cell-free supernatant, and thus secreted compounds likely mediated bacterial-nematode interactions. This model, which isolates interactions between bacteria and nematodes from the effects of prior feeding, demonstrates that bacteria can influence nematode behavior and their susceptibility to pathogens.</p>

<h4><em>Serratia</em> SCBI</h4>
<p>SCBI stands for Serratia <em>Caenorhabditis briggsae</em> Isolate: A tentative name for a bacterium that was isolated from a Galleria mellonella trapped C. briggsae worms which apparently killed the trap and hence showed the tell tell sign of an entomopathogenic partnership like the ones documented for the <em>Xenorhabdus-Steinernematidae</em> and <em>Photorhabdus-Heterorhabditidae</em> insecticidal partnerships and was shown to be a member of the Genus <em>Serratia</em> by16S rDNA sequence comparison.</p>
<p>Work at the <a href="http://hcgs.unh.edu/site/index.php">UNH Genome Center</a> has confirmed that the bacterium is indeed capable of rapid killing of <em>Galleria</em> larvae both by direct injection as well as by carriage with <em>C. elegans</em> and <em>C. briggsae</em>. Following this demonstrations, we have produced a draft genomic sequence by 454 technology and comparative analysis of the genome against the two already completed <em>Serratia</em> genomic sequences -<em>S. marcescens</em> DB11 (SANGER, EBI) and <em>S. proteamaculans</em> (DOE, JGI) and the established entomopathogenic bacterium -<em>P. luminescens TT01</em> (Pasteur)- is currently underway.</p>
