<p>Changing climate and land use patterns increase the frequency of conditions favorable for Vibrio in estuaries and thus increase the probability of human infections from shellfish consumption. We now must better understand ecological dynamics that drive Vibrio abundance and risk of illness. This project, which uses cutting-edge population genetics and genomics, focuses on how physical factors, such as temperature, salinity, and dissolved nutrients, affect vibrios within the context of other resident microbes within oysters. We hope to use these data to aid development of sensitive and accurate typing methods for pathogenic Vibrios in susceptible ecosystems. More generally, by examining the interplay of physical conditions and microbial community interactions on the emergence of pathogenic biovars, we will be better equipped to predict broader infectious threats and protect human health.</p>
