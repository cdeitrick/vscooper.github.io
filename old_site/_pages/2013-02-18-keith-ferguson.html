<p>My graduate research in Dr. Cooper’s lab focused on how populations of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> PA14 adapted to biofilm formation, development and dispersal. Broad goals of the project included measuring phenotypic and genetic diversity and quantifying fine-scale fitness effects of mutations observed in our model. A more specific goal included characterizing an adaptive allele in a polyphosphate kinase (<em>ppk</em>) gene.</p>
<p>As a recent graduate, I’m looking to find a career in the biotech field and am interested in the uses of genetically engineered microbes for industrial applications.</p>
