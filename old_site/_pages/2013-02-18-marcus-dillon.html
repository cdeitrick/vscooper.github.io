<p><em><strong>Personal</strong></em></p>
<p>I am currently in the fourth year of my PhD in Microbiology in the Cooper Lab at the University of New Hampshire.  I work with several bacteria (<em>E. coli, B. cenocepacia, V. cholerae</em>, and <em>V. fischeri</em>) and am interested in questions about the evolution of mutation rates, selection for genome organization, historical contingency, and the distribution of pleiotropic effects of beneficial mutations.  I graduated with a BA in Biology and French from Wake Forest University in 2011, where I worked with <em>S. cerevisiae</em> in Cliff Zeyl’s lab to examine an evolutionary trade-off between growth rate and yield during a long-term experimental evolution.  While attending Wake Forest, I also competed for both the Track and Cross Country teams.  In my spare time I like to stay active and watch the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Blue Jays, and Buffalo Bills, whose lack of success over the last 15+ years has contributed greatly to my education.</p>
<p><em><strong>Research Interests</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>1) Evolution of Gene Organization and Mutation Rate</strong></p>
<p>A central dogma of evolutionary theory suggests that genetic variation is created through random mutation, which natural selection acts upon to enrich beneficial variants and purge harmful ones.  However, recent evidence has suggested that mutation is not entirely random and that different genomic regions evolve at different rates.  This variation in the mutation rate could provide a mechanism through which selection acts on genome organization to influence the origin of variation (mutation), as well as its fate.  I’m interested in examining the extent to which natural selection has shaped bacterial genome organization using a risk-benefit type analysis, where the most important genes are housed in low mutation rate, high expression regions, and less important genes are housed in high mutation rate, low expression regions.  Understanding mutation is central to diseases like cancer and dementia, conservation of small populations on the verge of extinction, and the rapid spread of pathogen resistance.</p>
<p><strong>2) Role of Historical Contingency in Adaptive Evolution</strong></p>
<p>The extent to which an individual is capable of adapting to an environment can be influenced by its evolutionary past.  I’m interested in examining how both starting fitness and mutations in different genome locations influence subsequent adaptation to selective environments.  This project is relevant to the general potential for organisms to evolve to new environments from low fitness states, as well as the evolutionary rescue of populations nearing extinction.</p>
<p><strong>3) Pleiotropic Effects of Beneficial Mutations</strong></p>
<p>How beneficial mutations in one environment effect fitness in alternative environments is poorly understood.  By combining high-throughput collection methods for isolating beneficial mutations and precise fitness measurements, I’m interested in quantifying the pleiotropic effects of beneficial mutations in <em>E. coli</em> strains that vary in their evolutionary history.  Through examining these mutations I hope to contribute to our understanding of how adaptive history influences the pleiotropic breadth of beneficial mutations.  Whether poorly adapted or well adapted genotypes are more are more likely to be pleiotropic, and whether certain genotypes are predisposed to be more antagonistically pleiotropic is broadly relevant to many evolutionary concepts including speciation, senescence, and human pathogen emergence.</p>
