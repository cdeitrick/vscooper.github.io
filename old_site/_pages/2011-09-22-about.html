<p>I've been a competitive triathlete since 1990 and have completed 20 Ironmans, including 7 trips to the Hawaii Ironman World Championships. Some of my results can be found here: [<a href="http://www.athlinks.com/myresultsadv.aspx?rid=65866712">http://www.athlinks.com/myresultsadv.aspx?rid=65866712</a>]</p>
<p>Erika and I are also lifers in the sport of water polo. I coached the women's team at Michigan State University and the men's team at the University of Michigan (2003 Big Ten and National Champions). I reffed NCAA water polo through the CWPA.</p>
