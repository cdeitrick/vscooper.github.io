### Our Mission is to translate evolutionary biology to improve human health, reveal the origins of biodiversity and empower K-12 education!

### Vision

We study the evolution, ecology, and genome dynamics of experimental and clincal microbial populations.  The Following questions motivate our work:

1)  How do microbes adaptively evolve when colonizing eukaryotic hosts, either as
    pathogens or symbionts? Can we predict these dynamics and identify driver
    mechanisms to guide therapy?

2)  How do bacteria evolve and form communities within biofilms, especially within
    infections? What does this teach us about nascent multicellularity?
    
3)  How and why do ecological tradeoffs evolve?

4)  Evolution is best taught by hands-on experimentation. How do we deliver this on a
    massive scale?
