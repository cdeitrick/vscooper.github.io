<p><strong>Senior Research Technician IV</strong> Department of Microbiology &amp; Molecular Genetics, Bridgeside Point, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</p>
<p>Position Description</p>
<p>A Senior Research Technician position is available in the new laboratory of Dr. Vaughn Cooper in the Department of MMG at Bridgeside Point II. The primary focus of the Cooper laboratory is to use genomics, molecular genetics, and experimental evolution to understand bacterial adaptation during infections. We are especially interested in adaptation in bacterial biofilms, which cause a large fraction of human infections. The Senior Research Technician will work closely with the Principal Investigator, with postdoctoral researchers, and with research trainees.</p>
<p>The Senior Research Technician will have broad responsibilities including general lab oversight, necessary ordering, microbiological assays, and preparation of genomic DNA for sequencing. The position requires that the technician be able to learn a workflow of sample preparation for high-throughput sequencing and, following sequencing, the distribution of data to researchers in and outside of the laboratory. This position provides an outstanding opportunity to gain expertise in high-throughput genomics and make intellectual contributions to projects supported by NIH, NSF, and NASA. Strong organizational and interpersonal skills are a must. Candidate must be highly motivated to learn, be detail-oriented, able to prioritize multiple tasks and to work semi-independently.</p>
<p>Education requirements: B.S. in biological science, or equivalent work experience. Education Required M.S. or equivalent work experience. Overall Related Experience Level Required 3-5 years experience</p>
<p>Additional Education and/or Experience Essential to the Position This position requires prior experience in microbiology, molecular biology, and genetics. It is expected that experience will also document good organizational skills and an ability to work independently. Proficiency in spreadsheet-based data analysis is essential and experience in a Linux/Unix computational environment desirable.</p>
