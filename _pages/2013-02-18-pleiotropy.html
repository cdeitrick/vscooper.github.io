<h4><strong>What is the distribution of pleiotropic fitness effects among beneficial mutations?</strong></h4>
<div id="page-content">
<p>The rare fraction of mutations that are beneficial in any given environment are poorly understood. Even less certain is how these mutations tend to influence fitness in other environments: mutational effects could be limited to a single condition or have widespread consequences in many environments. This project uses high-throughput methods for isolating mutants from experimentally evolved bacterial populations that differ from a common ancestral genotype by a single mutation that is beneficial in the selective environment (first-step beneficial mutations). The pleiotropic (correlated) fitness effects of these mutants are then precisely measured through direct competition with the ancestor in a range of foreign environments. This project seeks to define the relationship between adaptation and changes in niche breadth and to characterize the biological networks that link genetics, physiology, and ecology.</p>
<h4><strong>How does previous adaptive history influence the pleiotropic effects of adaptive mutations?</strong></h4>
<p>Exactly how an organism adapts to an environment is likely influenced by its evolutionary past.  Here, we ask how evolutionary history will influence the pleiotropic effects of first step beneficial mutations by collecting beneficial mutations in both derived genotypes, which have previously adapted to the selective environment, and naive genotypes, which are new to the selective environment.   Specifically, we were able to capitalize on derived and naive starting genotypes isolated from previously characterized <em><a href="http://www.micropopbio.org/cooperlab/research/biofilm-burkholderia/" target="_blank">B. cenocepacia</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/index.html" target="_blank">E. coli</a> </em>long-term experimentally evolved populations. We were than able to further evolve these genotypes, collect first-step beneficial mutations, and measure their pleiotropic effects across alternative environments.  How poorly adapted and well adapted genotypes influence other phenotypes to variable degrees, and the extent to which these interactions are antagonistic are some of the primary questions that we pose in this project.</p>
<h4><strong>How does the selective environment influence the pleiotropic effects of adaptive mutations?</strong></h4>
<p>We are also interested in how the pleiotropic effects differ among mutations that result from adaptation to different environments.  Again, we use <em>B. cenocepacia</em> and <em>E. coli</em> as model organisms to collect beneficial mutations in different environments, then measure the correlated effects of these mutations.  Whether adaptation to more permissive environments vs. more stringent environments lead to broader pleiotropic effects, and whether these effects tend to be more antagonistic or synergistic are some of the main questions that we're seeking to address with this study.</p>
<h4><strong>Experimental Evolution in the Classroom</strong> <strong>(Outreach)</strong></h4>
<p>An important benefit of our approach is that it allows high school and college students to study “evolution in action” and explore the widespread effects of single mutations. We are currently collaborating with three area high schools to develop our protocols. With higher-throughput methods for measuring fitness and identifying mutations, we are now poised to produce the best and most nuanced database of adaptive mutations to address numerous basic problems in evolutionary genetics.  <strong>See our <a href="http://www.micropopbio.org/teaching/" target="_blank">outreach website</a> for more details, and please <a href="http://www.micropopbio.org/teaching/contact-us/" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you are interested in participating.</strong></p>
