<p>I’m currently a technician in Dr. Vaughn Cooper’s lab studying adaptive history of a long term experimental evolution of <em>B. cenocepacia</em>. I received my Master's working in Vaughn's lab in the summer of 2012.</p>
<p>Interests and research questions:</p>
<p>What are the evolutionary steps toward building a stable ecological community from a founding clone?</p>
<p>When adapting to a specific environment, are there many ways to improve or will replicate communities follow a parallel evolutionary trajectory?</p>
<p>Using metagenomics of evolving populations to track beneficial alleles over time.</p>
<p>A major interest and ongoing effort of mine is figuring out why certain physiological changes that occur during an evolution result in a selective advantage. Does epistasis occur in genotypes with multiple mutations or does each mutation act alone?</p>
<p>What are the evolutionary dynamics between any two long-lasting genetic variants an a stable ecological community?<br />
Clonal interference?<br />
Cooperation?<br />
Niche displacement?</p>
<p>How do bottlenecks and different selective regimes influence the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity?</p>
<p>How much genetic hitchhiking occurs in the progress of a selective sweep? Does a sweep of any fixed allele rely on subsequent selectively advantageous variation in order to take over a population or does variation exist on a fixed background as a result of the fixed allele?</p>
<p>Do any two isolates with similar phenotypes and/or genetic mutations behave in a similar manner in the community they arose in? Are they in competition or do they occupy separate niches?</p>
