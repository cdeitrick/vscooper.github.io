<p>We conduct experimental evolution, both <em><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/3/E250.abstract.html">in vitro</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=828204cd25526410VgnVCM100000290115acRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=0eb29de99a803410VgnVCM100000290115acRCRD">in vivo</a></em>, to understand bacterial evolution and ecology during infections. We have learned that adaptation involves both a sequence of mutations in some <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754314001840">predictable targets</a> but also diversification into <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12581/abstract">ecologically differentiated subpopulations</a>. In some conditions, these subpopulations produce <a href="http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v5/n3/full/ismej2010136a.html">synergistic interactions</a>, with certain types affecting host response and others enhancing resistance. In addition, we now routinely sequence the genomes of hundreds of bacterial isolates from longitudinal samples to define evolutionary forces affecting the courses of infection and the driver mutations, whose functions we work to experimentally identify.</p>
