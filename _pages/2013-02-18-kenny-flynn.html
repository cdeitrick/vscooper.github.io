<h2 id="toc0">Research Interests:</h2>
<h3 id="toc1">1. The evolution and maintenance of diversity in <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> PA14 biofilms.</h3>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen shown to have the capacity to adapt to the lungs of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient and cause persistent infections. Adaptation to this environment seen in clinical studies commonly involves diversification of an environmental strain into morphotypes conferring genetic changes such as the loss of flagellar-based motility and the accumulation of mutations in other biofilm-related virulence factors such as type III secretion systems and quorum sensing .</p>
<h3 id="toc3">2. How the environment affects pre-existing epistatic interactions of <em>Escherichia coli</em> and the potential consequence on adaptation</h3>
<p>The fitness effect of individual mutational change in the genome of an organisms can vary depending on interactation with their genetic and external environment. The form of these interactions is important because it can alter adaptive outcomes, selecting for or against certain combinations of beneficial mutations or genotypes. To determine the prevalence and magnitude of such interactions, we examine how interactions between beneficial mutations favored during adaptation of a lab strain of <em>Escherichia coli</em> to one simple environment (minimal media with glucose) are altered when the strain is grown in two novel environments. We found that fitness effects were greatly influenced by both the genetic and external environments. In several instances an environmental reversed the effect of a mutation or caused combinations of beneficial mutations to become deleterious. Our results have implications concerning adaptation in a complex or fluctuating environment that may favor combinations of mutations whose interactions may be less sensitive to external conditions. With growing opportunities to survey dynamics of many genotypes within evolving populations, studies like our work will be possible to examine how frequently pleiotropy and epistasis guide adaptive evolution.</p>
<h3 id="toc4">3. Association between replication timing and chromosome position on evolutionary rates of genes.</h3>
<p>Flynn, K.M. and V.S. Cooper. How replication dynamics affect the evolutionary rates and dispensability of genes in Sulfolobus.</p>
<p>In bacterial chromosomes, the position of a gene relative to the single origin of replication generally reflects its replication timing, how often it is expressed, and consequently its rate of evolution. However, because some archaeal genomes contain multiple origins of replication, bias in gene dosage caused by delayed replication should be minimized and hence the substitution rate of genes should associate less with chromosome position. However, linear regressions of both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates on distance from replication origins were significantly positive, the rates being greatest in the region furthest from any of the origins and slowest among genes near the origins in <em>Sulfolobus islandicus</em>. Increased evolutionary rates and gene dispensability are strongly associated with reduced gene expression caused in part by reduced gene dosage during the cell cycle. Therefore, in Archaea as well as in Bacteria, evolutionary rates and variation in genome content associate with replication timing.</p>
<p>Future directions include performing similar analyzes on other Archaeal genomes.</p>
