<p>I am an Undergraduate researcher that will be graduating with a B.S. in Microbiology in May 2013. I began working for Dr. Vaughn Cooper during my freshman year. Working in the Cooper lab provided me with an unique opportunity to experience a wide array of different fields including microbiology, genetics and ecology. I have worked on a variety of biofilm-related projects within both the <a href="biofilm-pseudomonas"><em>Pseudomonas</em> </a>and <a href="biofilm-burkholderia"><em>Burkholderia</em> </a>systems.  I also preformed screens of environmental samples of <em>Vibrio sp. </em>isolated from the Great Bay for virulence factors. In the summer of 2011 I worked for Dr. Bill McDowell tracing nitrogen contamination by detecting mtDNA in water samples from the Great Bay watershed.</p>
<p>My interests include microbial ecology, social community interactions and connecting observed patterns to molecular mechanisms. I also enjoy hands-on work with lab equipment and coming up with creative solutions to problems encountered while researching. As a result, I am the go-to person for fixing lab equipment and have developed a passion for engineering. My long-term career goal is to work in a multidisciplinary field that allows me to combine all my passions in research and development of new technology as these fields advance.</p>
<p>I am passionate about teaching and I am always excited to collaborate with others. I can be contacted at mec99@wildcats.unh.edu</p>
