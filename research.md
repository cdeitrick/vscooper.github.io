### Our laboratory seeks to understand how bacterial populations evolve and adapt to colonize hosts and cause disease.
By studying evolution-in-action, both in experimental populations and in ongoing infections, and using the latest methods in genomic sequencing, we seek to identify mechanisms of bacterial adaptation *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

## Biofilms
We are particularly focused on how bacterial populations form complex communities within biofilms and how cells perceive cues to attach or disperse.

## Origins of multicellularity
How different bacterial strains or species coexist and interact when bound together on a surface allows us to explore the origins of multicellular life. We are proud to be part of a [NASA Astrobiology Institute](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/teams/can-7/umt/) that uses experimental evolution to pursue the goal: 

`.notice` To discover the laws that create Darwin’s ‘tangled bank’ remains one of biology’s grand challenges, one that requires understanding how differences among forms are selected for and how interdependence among forms is enforced.

## Why genome regions evolve at different rates
In bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes, smaller, secondary chromosomes evolve more rapidly. We continue to explore the root causes of this variation as it may bear on variation in genome stability in all organisms. 

## EvolvingSTEM: evolution-in-action leads to inspired learning.
The real-time evolution of microbes into conspicuous new forms has inspired a high-school curriculum for learning evolutionary biology, ecology, and biotechnology by simple experimentation. Not only do students learn better, they become more engaged in science. We are working to share this curriculum nationwide.
