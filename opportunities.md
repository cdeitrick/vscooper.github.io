The Cooper laboratory is growing and is seeking researchers who share our goal in making evolutionary biology useful. We are currently seeking applicants for the following positions:

1. Postdoctoral Researcher, Experimental Evolution of Antimicrobial Resistance *in vitro* and *in vivo*. The aim of this project is to identify antibiotic-specific evolutionary pathways that lead to resistance under distinctive growth and immune-system pressures. This project focuses on how *S. pneumoniae, A. baumanii,* and *P. aeruginosa* evolve to become resistant under various antibiotic and host immune constraints, using genomics, transcriptomics, and state-of-the-immune-system profiling to identify selective forces and genetic and physiological responses to selection. This NIH U01 project is described [here](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9108644&icde=28937273) and involves PI's [Tim van Opijnen](http://www.vanopijnenlab.com/), [Ralph Isberg](http://sackler.tufts.edu/Faculty-and-Research/Faculty-Profiles/Ralph-Isberg-Profile), [Jason Rosch](https://www.stjude.org/directory/r/jason-rosch.html), and [Jose Bento](http://www.jbento.net/). We're looking for candidates with expertise in microbiology, genomics, and/or evolutionary biology.
