The Cooper laboratory is growing and is seeking researchers who share our goal in making evolutionary biology useful. We are currently seeking applicants for the following positions:

1. **Postdoctoral Researcher, Experimental Evolution of Antimicrobial Resistance** *in vitro* and *in vivo*. The aim of this project is to identify antibiotic-specific evolutionary pathways that lead to resistance under distinctive growth and immune-system pressures. This project focuses on how *S. pneumoniae, A. baumanii,* and *P. aeruginosa* evolve to become resistant under various antibiotic and host immune constraints, using genomics, transcriptomics, and state-of-the-immune-system profiling to identify selective forces and genetic and physiological responses to selection. This NIH U01 project is described [here](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9108644&icde=28937273) and involves PI's [Tim van Opijnen](http://www.vanopijnenlab.com/), [Ralph Isberg](http://sackler.tufts.edu/Faculty-and-Research/Faculty-Profiles/Ralph-Isberg-Profile), [Jason Rosch](https://www.stjude.org/directory/r/jason-rosch.html), and [Jose Bento](http://www.jbento.net/). We're looking for candidates with expertise in microbiology, genomics, and/or evolutionary biology.  
2. **Postdoctoral researcher, Mechanisms of Adaptation in Biofilms.** The overall goal of this project is to quantify eco-evolutionary dynamics in experimental biofilms and to define the precise targets of selection, which ultimately produce synergistic mixed communities. This project is focused in particular on how quorum-sensing and cyclic diguanylate signaling are coordinated to enable cells to produce the optimal stick-or-swim decision, and how variation in this decision associates with evolved diversity in biofilms. This work is supported by NIH and NASA and builds upon research reported in [Traverse et al PNAS 2013](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/3/E250.abstract.html?etoc), [Ellis et al Evolution 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12581/full), and [Cooper et al Genomics 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754314001840).
3. **Bioinformatics Research Staff**. This position, listed [here](https://www.pittsource.com/hr/postings/117344/preview), is as follows:  The Cooper lab generates and analyzes a wide range of genomic and transcriptomic data related to bacterial evolution during infections and in experimental laboratory and animal systems. Applicants must be proficient in one or more scripting languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, Perl) and familiar with Unix environments. This position provides an outstanding opportunity to gain expertise in high-throughput genomics and make intellectual contributions to projects supported by NIH, NSF, and NASA. Minimum requirements include a bachelors's degree in computational biology, bioinformatics, biological science, or equivalent work experience.
4. In addition, Ph.D. positions are available for projects 1 and 2. Please apply through the graduate program the best suits you
  a. [Biology](http://biology.pitt.edu/graduate)
  b. [Carnegie Mellon-Pitt Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/)
  c. [Molecular Virology and Microbiology](http://www.mvm.pitt.edu/)
