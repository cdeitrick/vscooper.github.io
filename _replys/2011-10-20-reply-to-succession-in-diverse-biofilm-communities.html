<p>I stumbled across some papers looking at long-term succession of structure and diversity in biofilm populations.</p>
<p>Martiny et al., 2003 notes a "rise and fall" or succession of population compositions over time in water pipes. In combination with my findings that there are two fixation events in the PA biofilms, it appears that perhaps something similar occurs in our system.<br />

<p>This paper also concludes that their findings agree with a proposed model by Jackson et al., 2001. The model suggest three stages: 1) initial colonization and competition for resources 2) reduced dominance of a single type and increased diversity and 3) more diversity due to displacement by either spatial or resource means. The following figure shows the change in OTUs in the water pipes over time. You can see an initial increase, a decrease presumably due to competition and then a huge increase in diversity.<br />
